00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490


2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:13,696
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:16,950


4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,580
You're watching Journey into
Mobile, and this is Level

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,840
Five, Responsive Media.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,530
In this level, we're going to
look at responsive images and

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,970
retina images.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,010
Let's first get started with
responsive images.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,880
Now up until this point, the
images in our layouts have

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,690
been fixed width.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,160
And this is an OK solution, but
it's not great if we want

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,060
to create responsive,
scalable sites.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,540
What we want to do is actually
have our images be able to

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,980
scale with the viewport size,
just like all of the rest of

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,000
our content.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,360
So how do we do that?

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,660
Well, there's really a two
step process here.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,730
The first is we want to actually
save out an image

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,520
that is larger than
we actually need.

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,670
For instance in our Nautilus
Restaurant site, we have this

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,480
image, which is actually 640
pixels by 490 pixels.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,880
Now, chances are we won't ever
actually need that image at

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
that size in our site, but what
we can do is if we save

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,750
it out larger, we can scale
it down as necessary.

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,200
And the way that we do that is
we're actually going to add a

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,300
max-width property to our image
element in our CSS.

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,530
And basically what this says is
if we have a set width for

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,790
our image, it tells the browser
to fill that set width

29
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,370
with 100% of the image.

30
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,490
So even if the image container
is smaller than the total size

31
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,800
of the image, we still get
the full resolution

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,780
image in that container.

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,040
I've already added the max-width
property up at the

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,380
top of my CSS styles to my image
element, but now what I

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,780
want to do is I want to call
the specific image in the

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,970
about section.

37
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,670
As you can see, this specific
image has a width of 29.6875%.

38
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,160
So that means that the
containing element is going to

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,290
scale, and as a result the image
is going to scale because

40
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,090
of the max-width property.

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,880
So let me go into the browser
and actually show

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,850
you how this works.

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,240
Alright, so if we look at our
Nautilus Restaurant site, I

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,400
want you to pay attention to the
image in the lower left.

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,030
Now notice as I expand and
contract the browser window,

46
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,350
the image also scales.

47
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,820
This is because we've
incorporated our max-width

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,280
property into our CSS and saved
out a larger image than

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,690
we actually need.

50
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,430
So as we get smaller and to a
mobile environment, we can

51
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,730
optimize the image for that
context, but then also we can

52
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,880
optimize the image as
we get into larger

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,930
environments, as well.

54
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,290
So not only can you do this with
images, you can actually

55
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,070
do this with any types of media,
and that can include

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,270
video, for instance.

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,820
So if you have a video embed in
your HTML, you can actually

58
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,430
cause that to be responsive so
that as your site scales, the

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,560
video element can
scale as well.

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,090
Now just like practically
everything else, there really

61
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,890
is no IE6 support for this.

62
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,580
So if you absolutely have to
support IE6 in your designs,

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,900
check out this link and it gives
you a good idea of how

64
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,250
to achieve that.

65
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,830
Now prior to Windows 7, there
was poor support for the

66
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,390
max-width property, so if you
need to support browsers-- in

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,940
particular, Firefox 2 and IE7 on
devices that are lower than

68
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,060
Windows 7--

69
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,570
take a look at this link where
it teaches you how to use

70
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,680
AlphaImageLoader, which is
another solution to be able to

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,525
achieve this max-width property
on these devices and

72
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:26,950
in these browsers.

73
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,350
So that's how you scale images
and other types of media

74
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,580
responsively.

75
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,770
But if you're looking for more
robust options to do that,

76
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,670
here are a few alternatives
to look at.

77
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,090
Now, these are JavaScript
libraries that you can

78
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,210
incorporate into your sites
which give you more options as

79
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,470
it comes to making things
responsive.

80
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,740
Alright, so let's talk
about retina images.

81
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,640
Now with the new iPad that
recently came out and with

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,780
iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, retina
images have become more of an

83
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,160
issue, because as you know,
retina screens have 1.5 to two

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,500
times the pixel density, which
means that if you save out a

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,220
normal image on a retina screen
it might look kind of

86
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,260
blurry or even pixelated.

87
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,220
And that's not good if you're
trying to optimize your

88
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,290
designs for a variety of devices
on the universal web.

89
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,170
So what do we do?

90
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,540
Do we double the image size?

91
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,430
Well, we could but that's not
a great solution, because

92
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,890
obviously you're talking about
larger images, larger

93
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,120
downloads, slower site speed.

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,690
We can actually use media
queries to target those

95
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,380
specific devices and optimizer
images for retina displays,

96
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,930
and here's how we
would do that.

97
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,440
In this media query, we're
targeting devices that have a

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,930
pixel density of at least 1.5.

99
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,580
Now the iPhone 4S, the 4, and
the new iPad had have pixel

100
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,170
densities of two, but some
Android devices have 1.5.

101
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,520
So what this is doing is saying
at least 1.5 and up, so

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,460
we can cover all of our bases.

103
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,050
And what we do is we would put
our styles within that media

104
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,700
query, including our retina
images, and here's how we

105
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,870
would do that.

106
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,230
Let's hypothetically say we have
a logo file, logo.png,

107
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,330
that has a size of 200 pixels.

108
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,290
So the idea here is that we
would want to actually double

109
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,020
this image size, so we would
save out a new logo file at

110
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,400
400 pixels.

111
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,810
And you can call it whatever you
want but a good practice

112
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,620
is to follow the iOS convention
for retina images

113
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,330
and that is the same name of
the file with an @2x before

114
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,950
the file extension.

115
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,230
So let's go back to our demo
site, the Nautilus Bar and

116
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,640
Restaurant, and let's look at
an example of how we can

117
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,060
actually apply this.

118
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,040
So as you can see in our
Map It button, we

119
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,880
have this map icon.

120
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,600
The original size of it is 12
pixels by 16 pixels, so what

121
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,420
we want to do is save out a new
image that is 24 pixels by

122
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,990
32 pixels-- it's double
the size--

123
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,220
and then we would actually put
that into our media query.

124
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,070
First, let's recall our
original CSS for this

125
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,800
particular file.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,350
As you can see, we have a
logo.png, and we have it set

127
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,920
as a background image.

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,830
So if we plug this into our
media query, here's what it

129
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,750
would look like.

130
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,550
As you can see, we have our own
new file, the logo@2x.png,

131
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,800
but we've also included CSS3
background size property.

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
Now, why have we done this?

133
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,640
Well, if we don't do this, then
the browser is going to

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,480
serve up this new image
at its original size.

135
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,500
Basically, what we wanted
to do is keep the same

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,190
constraints as the original
image, the same size, just

137
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,190
double the pixel density
so that it looks

138
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,940
better on retina screens.

139
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,820
So by using the background size
property, we can tell the

140
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,070
browser what the original size
of the image was, but just

141
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,060
fill it with the better
optimized image.

142
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,840
And then as you can see in this
screen shot, our image

143
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,900
looks much better.

144
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,370
It's much clearer and crisper
than our original image was.

145
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,590
So this point, we've seen two
examples of how to make images

146
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,720
responsive.

147
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,150
We've talked about content
images and how to actually

148
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,290
scale those, and we've talked
about background images,

149
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,730
things like logos or like the
map icon that you saw.

150
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,140
But for both of those examples,
we still have to

151
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,430
worry about file size because
we can save out a bunch of

152
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,950
these very high resolution
photos that would look great

153
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,680
on, say, a retina screen, but
if you didn't have a retina

154
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,950
screen you'd have to download
these huge files and it would

155
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,570
look good, but it would just
work really slowly and

156
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,900
wouldn't be optimal.

157
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,160
So what do we do?

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,340
Well, Scott Jehl has created a
pretty novel concept called

159
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,920
PictureFill that really solves
this problem that we have.

160
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,730
And in this case, what we do is
we create a picture element

161
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,790
that's similar to the video
element in HTML5.

162
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,260
And what it does is it specifies
different image

163
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,450
sizes to be served by different
devices, depending

164
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,360
on if they're a retina device
or a nonretina device.

165
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,470
Let me show you how
this works.

166
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,050
So in this case, as you can see,
we have our picture tag,

167
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,510
and within that we have first
our regular image,

168
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,170
content-image.jpeg, that's going
to be used for generic

169
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,510
devices, nonretina devices.

170
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,660
Then we're also including a
larger image, one that can be

171
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,640
served up on retina devices that
has more pixel density.

172
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,270
But in this case, we're only
going to be serving that up

173
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,190
for devices that have a minimum
width of 800 pixels.

174
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,570
So once again, we're using that
media query concept where

175
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,130
we're only going to be serving
up that image if that device

176
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,980
has a min width of 800 pixels.

177
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,490
Now, the picture element
doesn't actually exist.

178
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,180
It's not part of
the HTML5 spec.

179
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,950
So what we have to do is include
picturefill.js in the

180
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,240
head of our HTML document.

181
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,920
And who knows, maybe someday
they'll actually adopt this to

182
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,230
be a part of the HTML5 spec
and we can use it

183
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,010
as much as we want.

184
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,539
Now what happens to those
users that don't have

185
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,200
JavaScript enabled?

186
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Well, we can create a fallback
for those users.

187
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,010
We can include the same code
that we talked about before in

188
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,770
our picture element, but at the
bottom we can include our

189
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,370
regular image in
no script tags.

190
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,030
And basically what that means is
if the user has JavaScript

191
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,830
disabled, then we're just going
to serve up the regular

192
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,080
image to that device.

193
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,670
Congratulations, you've made
it through all the videos.

194
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,010
You still have some challenges
to complete, and after that be

195
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,530
sure to stay tuned for a wrap-up
video where I'll give

196
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,090
you some further resources to
help you learn more about

197
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,800
designing for the mobile web.

198
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Thanks for taking the time.

199
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,080
I really appreciate it, and
we'll talk to you later.

200
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,645
