00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,990
You're watching Journey into
Mobile and this is Level

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,090
Three, Adaptive Adventures.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,100
In this level, we're going
to talk about what

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,100
adaptive web design is.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,260
We're also going to talk about
break points and why they

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,900
matter, and then finally
we're going to

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,759
introduce media queries.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,170
So what is adaptive design?

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,240
Well, essentially, adaptive
design is designing for

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,190
controlled adaptation.

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,260
And basically what this means
is you know the device or

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,750
design context that you need
to design for, and then you

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,460
design accordingly.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,120
So let's use a real world
example to better illustrate

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,750
this concept, and we're
going to use

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,680
the design site Dribbble.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,440
Now, Dribbble was originally
created as a desktop web app,

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,930
and what they found is that
more and more users were

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,490
accessing the site through
their mobile devices.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,635
Now if you have a smartphone, an
iPhone, or an Android, you

24
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:10,570
know desktop optimized sites
work on a mobile device but

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,900
usually you have to zoom in a
lot and swipe a lot, and it's

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,650
not exactly an optimal
experience for mobile.

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,280
So the guys at Dribbble realized
this and started to

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,930
think about, OK, what could they
do in order to optimize

29
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,440
the site for a mobile context.

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,160
Well, they could have done
one of two things.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,900
They could have created an
entirely separate mobile site

32
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,620
using separate markup, separate
styles, separate

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,790
content, which is a totally
legitimate option if you need

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,700
to do that.

35
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,220
They could have created an
adaptive design where they

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,430
adapt the styles from the
desktop site to a mobile

37
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,370
environment, or they could
create a responsive site,

38
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,880
which we'll actually cover
in a little bit.

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,610
What they did is they chose an
adaptive approach to their

40
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,850
design and they adapted the
styles of their CSS from the

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,770
desktop environment to a mobile
environment, creating

42
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,010
an optimal environment if you're
on your laptop or a

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,600
desktop computer but also
creating an optimal

44
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,990
environment if you're
accessing the

45
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,740
site on a mobile device.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,180
Adaptive design doesn't mean
that you're covering all the

47
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,850
needs for the universal web.

48
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,410
Usually what it means you are
designing for a specific

49
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,000
context, and that context might
be the device, it might

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,010
be screen size, it might
be resolution.

51
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,250
But the bottom line is you know
what it is and you're

52
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,350
specifically targeting
that context.

53
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,180
Now with any design, important
to consider four basic

54
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,750
principles.

55
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,660
You need to know who your user
is, you need to know how

56
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,860
they're going to use the site,
you need to know the context

57
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,780
in which they're going to use
it, so that could be what

58
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,260
device they're using or in what
environment they're using

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,180
it, and then finally, you need
to know what your content is

60
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,580
and how that content is going to
adapt based on the context.

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
So to better illustrate this,
we're going to use another

62
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,570
demo site, and what we've done
is created a fictitious

63
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,300
restaurant called the Nautilus
Bar and Restaurant.

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,610
If we apply our four design keys
to the restaurant site,

65
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,630
what we come up with is that
our user probably wants to

66
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,660
either find the restaurant
or learn more about it.

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,490
The context is they're probably
going to be accessing

68
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,360
the site either on their laptop
or maybe on a mobile

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,390
device, and therefore their
content needs to include

70
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,610
location info, needs to include
a menu, and needs to

71
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,990
include information about
the restaurant.

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,360
It probably doesn't need to
include those irrelevant

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,340
iStock photos of random people
eating, for instance.

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,010
So in our case we're going to be
adapting the design from a

75
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,540
desktop environment to a mobile
environment just like

76
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,190
the Dribbble example.

77
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,710
So here's what we want our site
to look like in a mobile

78
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,860
context, and here's what we want
our site to look like in

79
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,700
a desktop environment.

80
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,340
Alright, so when we cover
adaptive web design, we really

81
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,980
want to look at three
main things.

82
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,420
The first is our markup, the
second is our break points,

83
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,300
and the third is going to be
our media queries that

84
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,950
actually make this work.

85
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,190
So real quickly, let's go ahead
and take a look at how

86
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,800
the site is structured.

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,420
We have our main header section
up here at the top,

88
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,320
then we have our menu content
here in the middle, and

89
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,930
finally we wrap up at the bottom
of our page with our

90
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,400
about section.

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,140
Next, let's cover
break points.

92
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,180
What are break points?

93
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,370
Well, essentially break
points are where your

94
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,130
design breaks down.

95
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,040
Now, in an adaptive approach
typically your break points

96
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,850
are going to be the height and
the width of the device or the

97
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,040
context that you're targeting.

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,250
Now when we talk about a mobile
context, this could

99
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,750
mean a number of different
things.

100
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,200
We have iPhones, we have
Android phones, we have

101
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,000
Kindles, we have iPads, so when
we're talking about a

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,810
mobile context, we need to
know what specific mobile

103
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,630
context we want to target.

104
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,700
In our case, we're going to keep
it simple and we're going

105
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,830
to use the size for our
standard iPhone.

106
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,890
In this case, it's going to be
a height of 480 pixels and

107
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,430
it's going to be a width
of 320 pixels.

108
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,600
One of the things you might be
asking is, well, what about

109
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,250
the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 4S?

110
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,380
Well, those have double the
pixel density, but they still

111
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,360
have the same size when it comes
to browser size, so we

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,130
actually don't need to double
the size of our break points.

113
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,130
We can keep the height and the
width exactly the same, but

114
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,790
when we talk about things like
images we're going to have to

115
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,090
deal with pixel density.

116
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,530
We'll actually cover that
in a future level.

117
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,390
Alright, so how do we
make this all work?

118
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,080
Well, to make it work we have
to use media queries.

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,460
Now you might be familiar with
media queries or at least the

120
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,120
foundations for them if you've
ever written, say, a print

121
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,370
style sheet.

122
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,540
And you might have seen
something like this, where you

123
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,200
put these in the head of
your HTML document.

124
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,300
And basically what this is
saying is we're telling the

125
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,350
browser, hey, for this
particular device or for this

126
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,380
particular thing, use this
CSS style sheet.

127
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,220
And the W3C actually came out
with a new query a few years

128
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,250
back where they actually
targeted mobile devices.

129
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,170
The problem with this is there's
a number of different

130
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,630
mobile devices, so if we use one
style sheet it might look

131
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,350
great on an iPhone but it might
look terrible on, say,

132
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,850
your mom's old Nokia.

133
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,450
So this wasn't a good solution
when we're talking about the

134
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,860
universal web.

135
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,520
So as part of the CSS3 spec, the
media query was introduced

136
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,060
and this is what
it looks like.

137
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,560
We have two main items here.

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,130
First, we have the media type--
in this case, we're

139
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,610
looking at screens--

140
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,330
and then we have the actual
query itself,

141
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,680
max-width of 320 pixels.

142
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,420
And then beneath that, we put
all of the styles that we want

143
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,530
to be contained inside
that media query.

144
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,350
So what is this actually telling
the browser to do?

145
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,620
Well, essentially it's saying
for any of viewport that is

146
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,950
less than or equal to 320 pixels
in width, use these

147
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,190
styles over our original
styles.

148
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,850
And if we use max-width, it
stands to reason that we can

149
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,460
also use min-width.

150
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,610
So in this case, what we're
saying is for a viewport size

151
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,070
that is greater than
or equal to 1024

152
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,000
pixels, use these styles.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,930
Now there are a number of other
options that we could

154
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,350
put into our media queries and
we'll actually cover those in

155
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,010
a future level, but for the time
being we're just going to

156
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,820
stick to these simple min-width

157
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,850
and max-width examples.

158
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,230
Alright, so where do you
put your media queries?

159
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,240
You could make a separate style
sheet for each, but that

160
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,690
would be pretty cumbersome and
it would also increase the

161
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,320
load time for your site.

162
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,090
It's a better practice to put
your media queries in a group

163
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,910
at the bottom of your style
sheet like you see here.

164
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,190
It's easier to maintain, it's
easier to find, and it doesn't

165
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,980
increase the load time
as much as including

166
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,580
separate style sheets.

167
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,040
So for our demo site, the
Nautilus Bar and Restaurant,

168
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,900
we can actually have two media
queries, one at 320 pixels,

169
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,320
which is the iPhone in portrait
mode, and one at 480

170
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,240
pixels, which is the iPhone
in landscape mode.

171
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,900
But if you recall back to level
two when we talked about

172
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,350
fluid layouts, we've actually
built the site on a fluid

173
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,410
foundation.

174
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,470
So what that means is the site
can actually scale based on

175
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,980
the viewport size.

176
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,110
And this is great, because it
means that we don't have to do

177
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,110
extra work.

178
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,930
We can actually set the value
of the media query to be the

179
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,050
higher version-- in this
case, 480 pixels--

180
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,160
and we know that when we turn
the iPhone into portrait mode,

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,100
the design is going to
scale appropriately

182
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,840
because it's fluid.

183
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
Alright, let's look at our
styles for our desktop site,

184
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,160
and then we'll actually adapt
to those to our mobile site.

185
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,440
So first, we're looking
at our header area

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,140
for our desktop site.

187
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,710
As you can see, we have our main
logo image and then we

188
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,230
also have a bottom border
of 15 pixels.

189
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,450
Those are going to be the main
things that we change as we

190
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,420
adapt this portion to a
mobile environment.

191
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,120
And as you can see, we've
included a separate logo file

192
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,130
here, which is smaller,
and we've also

193
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,000
removed that bottom border.

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,740
And here's what it looks like
in a mobile environment.

195
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,220
Next, what we want to do is we
want to actually move the

196
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,960
location and contact information
beneath the logo.

197
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,080
In the desktop environment
it was floated to the

198
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,409
right of the logo.

199
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,370
So as you can see, these are
our original desktop styles

200
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,270
where we have a lot of floats
and we also have a set width.

201
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,820


202
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,050
As we adapt to a mobile
environment, we're going to

203
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,860
clear all of those floats.

204
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,530
We're actually going to add a
background color, and we're

205
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,380
also going to stretch the width
to be the full width of

206
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,370
the viewport.

207
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,370
And as you can see, now we have
all of that information,

208
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,220
it looks great beneath
the logo.

209
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,030
Now for our menu section in our
desktop environment, we

210
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,640
have our two menu blocks floated
to the left and the

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,930
right of each other, but this
isn't going to work on a

212
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,080
mobile environment because those
boxes would get really

213
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,520
small and you wouldn't be able
to even read the menu.

214
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,520
So what we want to do is
actually stack these on top of

215
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,490
one another.

216
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,090
So as you can see in our desktop
styles, we've defined

217
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,830
a width and a percentage and
we have those floats.

218
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,390
As we adapt that to a mobile
environment, we're going to

219
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,400
actually allow the width to
inherit the full width of the

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,210
viewport size, and then we're
going to clear those floats.

221
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,570
So instead of having them
floated next to each other,

222
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,630
we're actually going to have
them stacked on top of each

223
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,640
other, which is a much more
readable design for a mobile

224
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,540
environment.

225
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,820
So let me show you what that
looks like in the browser.

226
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,660


227
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,910
So first let's take a look
at our desktop site.

228
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,530
As you can see, we have our logo
up here at the top with

229
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,180
our location information
floated to the right.

230
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,810
We have our menu section here,
the two blocks, and then we

231
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,090
have our about section
beneath that.

232
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,590
Let's go ahead and take a look
at how we've adapted these

233
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,870
styles to a mobile
environment.

234
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,240
And as we pull up our iPhone
here, you can see that we have

235
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,400
our logo centered-- it's a
little smaller-- and we have

236
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,460
all of our location information

237
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,960
stacked beneath that.

238
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,010
Our menu section is stacked on
top of each other, and we've

239
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,370
actually stretched the width
of the image in our about

240
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,960
information to the full
width of the viewport.

241
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,690
So this is an optimal design
for mobile, and this is an

242
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,680
optimal design for
desktop, as well.

243
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,110


244
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,510
Alright, now it's time for you
to work on some challenges.

245
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,460
Good luck on those and we'll
see you in the next level.

246
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,882
