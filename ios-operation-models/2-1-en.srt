[SINGING]

00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,460
He's got your data in his pocket
and a gun in his hand.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,555
He's got his finger on the
trigger and a secret plan.

4
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:10,340
He'll take mutable arrays and
put them in formation using

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,756
your view controllers for
his world domination.

6
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:15,020
He'll take your data into models.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,980
before it explodes, the
only secret agent

00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,920
who encodes and decodes.

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,170
He's Mr. Higgie.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,100
Welcome to Level 2 of iOS
Operation Models.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,220
In this level, we're going to
look at how we can efficiently

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,510
get data into our
model objects.

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,190
As I mentioned in the last
level, Planet Hig has a

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,630
controller called
CityViewController.

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,170
CityViewController contains a
view that has three subviews,

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,500
one for the name of the city,
one for the state that the

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,620
city is in, and one for the
population of that city, and

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,990
those are all stored
in UI labels.

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,300
So let's see where that
city data comes from.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,410
There's a JSON file called
cityData.json that contains

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,960
one NSDictionary, and that
NSDictionary has keys for two

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,005
NSStrings and one NSNumber.

23
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,200
Now the old way that we would
get this data inside of a view

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,830
controller is we would declare
a property of type

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,170
NSDictionary, and then we would
make an AFJSONRequest

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,990
Operation to get that JSON file,
and then store that JSON

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,050
response inside of
self.cityData.

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,380
Once we had the JSON response
stored, we'd call a method

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,710
like dataRetrieved so that we
could then draw our UI labels

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,360
and other subviews
on to the canvas.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,140
Here in dataRetrieved, all we're
doing is logging out the

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,100
JSON response to make sure
that the AFJSONRequest

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,700
operation worked properly.

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,080
This seems like a good
place for a model.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,110
That's right Mr. Higgie.

36
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,200
We can take all this
data and store it

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,610
inside of a city model.

38
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,740
To create that city model,
just like we did with the

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,640
place model, we need a city.h
and a city.m file.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,460
Just like with the place model,
our city model needs to

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,550
be a subclass of NSObject.

42
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,910
And in the city.h file, we
want to declare our three

43
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,240
properties as part
of the model--

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,810
name, state, and population--

45
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,250
and in the city.m file, want
to create our initializer.

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,930
Back in CityViewController,
we'll want to import City.h so

47
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,300
that we can access the
city model inside of

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,870
CityViewController, and we'll
want to change that

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,830
NSDictionary property
to a city property.

50
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,730
Then in CityViewController.m,
instead of storing the JSON

51
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,160
response in an NSDictionary,
we'll want to set each one of

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,550
the city model properties equal
to the values in the

53
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,230
JSON object.

54
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,020
Down in dataRetrieved, we can
then log out the model

55
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,920
properties instead of
the dictionary keys.

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,020
The problem here is that
the controller is still

57
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,930
responsible for fetching the
data, not the model.

58
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,350
We have a CityViewController
that's requesting a city model

59
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,160
template, and then it's
returning that template into

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,680
the view controller and setting
all the data from

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
inside the controller before
it displays on the view.

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,310
What we really want to
happen is we want the

63
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,600
CityViewController to still
request a model object, but we

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,090
want that model object to
initialize itself with data

65
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,470
and return a fully data-filled
copy back to the controller.

66
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,830
I love convenient solutions.

67
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,170
To implement an initWithJSON
convenience initializer, we

68
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,950
first need to declare that
initializer in the city.h

69
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,175
file, and then we need to
implement it in city.m.

70
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:53,760
the implementation of
initWithJSON is going to be a

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,400
pretty standard initializer,
except after we create a copy

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,450
of the self object and check if
it exists, we're going to

73
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,170
want to move all of our
AFJSONRequestOperation code

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,755
from CityViewController into the
initWithJSON initializer

75
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:10,100
in the city model.

76
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,370
Then, inside of the
AFJSONRequestOperation, we're

77
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,800
going to be setting the model
properties equal to the values

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,350
that are returned by the JSON.

79
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,500
Since we're inside of the city
class itself, we can reference

80
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,290
those model properties with
self.name, self.state, and

81
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,530
self.population instead of
first trying to create an

82
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,810
intermediary object to
access them through.

83
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,300
All we should have to do is
create a new city object using

84
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,490
the initWithJSON initializer,
and then we should be able to

85
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,110
NSLog the properties inside
of the object.

86
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,910
But when we try to do that
here, we get nil.

87
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,660
What the nil is going on?

88
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,100
To understand why these values
are coming up as nil, let's

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,090
look at what's happening
whenever we call the

90
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,400
initWithJSON method.

91
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,110
First, CityViewController
requests a copy of the city

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,140
object using the initWithJSON
method, which then fires

93
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,080
initWithJSON method
inside the model.

94
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,230
At the same time,

95
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,830
CityViewController doesn't stop.

96
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,280
It continues executing.

97
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,630
At some point in the future,
the model object returns an

98
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,760
instantiated copy of the city
object, and the view in

99
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,600
CityViewController tries
to display data.

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
The problem is that there's
no guarantee that the

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,330
initWithJSON method returns a
filled model before the views

102
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,910
in CityViewController
try to be displayed.

103
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,640
Some people refer to the way
this code is working as

104
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,550
non-blocking because the
CityViewController doesn't

105
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,290
stop and wait for the
model to come back.

106
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,180
It just keeps running.

107
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,880
The way that we can solve this
problem is using a tool called

108
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,810
Notifications, and the way this
is going to work is that

109
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,560
the controller is still going to
ask for a model, the model

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,260
is still going to call the
initWithJSON method, and then

111
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,400
when the initWithJSON method is
finished and data is fully

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,060
loaded, it's going to
post a notification.

113
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,520
Back in CityViewController,
there's going to be some code

114
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,490
that is listening for
notification to occur, and

115
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,660
when that notification occurs,
the views are going to be

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,010
filled with data.

117
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,570


118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,420
NS NotificationCenter is a
messaging center that can be

119
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,380
used by different parts of the
application to listen for

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,750
different events, or
notifications, happening.

121
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,040
In addition to listening, the
NSNotificationCenter can be

122
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,860
used to broadcast events,
which is called posting

123
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,930
notifications.

124
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,180
To post a notification,
you can send the

125
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,960
postNotificationName object
method to the

126
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,310
NSNotificationCenter
defaultCenter object, and to

127
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,330
listen for a notification, you
can send the addObserver

128
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,730
selector name object method to
the NSNotificationCenter

129
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,840
defaultCenter object.

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,250
The value for post-notification
name can be

131
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,130
any string that you want, but I
suggest naming it something

132
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,390
that makes sense.

133
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,820
So I've named this string
initWithJSONFinishedLoading,

134
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,580
because this is going to be a
message that we post whenever

135
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,740
initWithJSON finishes loading
all if its data.

136
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,640
Listening for a notification
has a few more arguments.

137
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,440
The first argument, observer,
is going to be whatever

138
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,890
instance will be listening
for the notification.

139
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,890
In our case, that's going
to be self, the

140
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,190
CityViewController.

141
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,210
The selector is going to be
a method that gets called

142
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,370
whenever the notification
is heard.

143
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,550
In this case, we're going to
call our dataRetrieved

144
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,530
selector, which then fills all
of our views with data.

145
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,240
The name argument is the name
of the notification, which

146
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,710
from our posting, was called
initWithJSONFinishedLoading,

147
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,460
and the object argument is an
optional argument that lets

148
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,940
you listen for notifications
that only come

149
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,760
from a specific object.

150
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,350
In this case, we want to listen
for that notification

151
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,050
coming from anywhere, so we'll
set that value to nil.

152
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,670
So back in initWithJSON, we're
going to want to post the

153
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,490
notification that initWithJSON
method has finished loading

154
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,300
after all of the data is set
inside each of the model

155
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,550
properties.

156
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,200
Then, in viewDidLoad in
CityViewController, we're

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,510
going to want to listen for
a notification with the

158
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,950
addObserver selector
name object method.

159
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,480
Once the notification is heard,
we're going to call the

160
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,240
dataRetrieved method that logs
out the state and population

161
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,860
values from the city object.

162
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,010
And we can see that those values
log properly now.

163
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,750
While we're optimizing things,
why not go ahead and make

164
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,360
initWithJSON the designated
initializer in the city model?

165
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,340
To do that, in city.m, we'll
just make sure to set self

166
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,940
equal to self initWithJSON
inside of the standard init

167
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,250
method, and then
CityViewController's

168
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,470
viewDidLoad, will call self.city
equals City alloc

169
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,870
init, instead initWithJSON, and
the initWithJSON method

170
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,970
will still run.

171
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,200
Notification name, OHYEAAAAAA!

172
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh yeah is right, Mr. Higgie.

173
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,700
And now it's time for you to
try some more challenges.
