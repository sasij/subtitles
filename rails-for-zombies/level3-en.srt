00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,830
I'm Gregg Pollack, and you're
watching Rails for Zombies,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,322
Episode Three.

3
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:18,830
[MUSIC  PLAYING]

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,010
In this episode, we're going to
be learning about the view,

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,150
which isn't always so pretty,
especially when

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,200
you're eating brains.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,780
Now when a web request comes to
our Rails stack, it's going

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,080
to be going through four
different components.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,380
We've already talked about the
component on the bottom, which

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,960
are the models.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,390
But now, we're going to be
talking about the view, which

12
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,280
is right about there.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,560
Let's take a look at the
directory structure of our

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,480
Twitter for Zombies
application--

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,060
might look a little
bit like this.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,920
You can see we have
an app directory.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,940
Inside that we have views.

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,660
Inside that we have the
zombie directory

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,380
and a tweets directory.

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,450
Inside the tweets directory, we
have an index.html.erb, and

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,510
a show.html.erb, one which shows
all the tweets and one

22
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,290
which shows a particular
tweet.

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,830
The file extension here
is .html.erb.

24
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,190
erb, I know what you're
thinking, it stands for Edible

25
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,720
Rotting Bodies.

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,870
No, no, not quite.

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,430
It actually stands for Embedded
Ruby, basically, Ruby

28
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,910
inside HTML.

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,970
Now let's take a look at
the show tweet action.

30
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,180
Here's what it might look
like in the browser.

31
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,150
So we're showing the status of
a particular tweet, and we're

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,110
showing which zombie
created the tweet.

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,920
Now Rails introduces two new
HTML tags, which we are going

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,750
to be using inside
of our erb files.

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,250
First, we have the
<% %> tag.

36
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,860
So anything in between this
tag is going to get

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,110
evaluated as Ruby.

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,530
Then we have the <%= %>
version of this tag,

39
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,180
which is going to evaluate
the Ruby.

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,140
And whatever that returns,
it's going to print

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,160
out onto the page.

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,760
Now if we open up the
show.html.erb, here's

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,260
what we might see.

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,770
You'll notice that we've
got some basic HTML

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,580
elements for a header.

46
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,190
We then have a
tweet = Tweet.find(1)

47
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,780
that should look familiar.

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,180
We're pulling in that tweet,
evaluating that Rails code.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,230
We then have a header, which
is the tweet status.

50
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,950
And we then say, posted
by tweet.zombie.name.

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,740
Oh, look out, here comes the
Zombie, and he's telling us

52
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,070
that our code sucks.

53
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,260
It does suck a little bit.

54
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,790
It sucks in two different
ways.

55
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,920
One of which is, obviously, if
you look at this code over

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,840
here, you'll notice that we have
some header code and some

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
footer code.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,370
And, obviously, if we continue
down this path, we would have

59
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,720
to copy and paste that
across all the pages,

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,010
which is not good.

61
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,480
So the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,140
take that header and the footer,
and we're going to put

63
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,610
that into a file called
application.html.erb, which is

64
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,230
in our layouts directory.

65
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,720
So we've got sort of core show
content down here, and we've

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,830
got the layout up here.

67
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,090
There's one thing we
have to add to this

68
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,790
layout, which is a yield.

69
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,930
So this is saying to Rails, at
this point, when you see this

70
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:12,590
yield, put the show view
code right in there.

71
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,990
So if we go back to our
directory layout, you'll see

72
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,490
that we're going to add a
layouts directory, and inside

73
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,300
there, our application.html.erb,
which is

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,040
our main layout for the site.

75
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,870
There's a couple other things
that you're going to see in

76
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,080
the default Rails layout.

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,650
You're going to see a style
sheet link to tag, a

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,290
JavaScript include tag,
and a csrf meta tag.

79
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,085
Now we're going to go through
each of these items so that

80
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,100
you understand what they
mean, starting with

81
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,680
stylesheet_link_tag.

82
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,020
Basically, what this is
saying is include all

83
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,400
of the stylesheets.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,120
It's going to look inside the
public directory, inside the

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,070
stylesheets directory, and all
the stylesheets that's

86
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,310
going to include them, and
render out something that

87
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,560
looks a little bit like this.

88
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,090
Next up is the
javascript_include_tag.

89
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,570
So it's going to be including
all of the default JavaScript.

90
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,820
Where is it including it from?

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,400
Well, it's going to look in
the public javascripts

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,680
directory, and, by default, in
a Rails app, it's going to be

93
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,000
including all of these
JavaScript files, which you

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,920
may recognize as being the

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,990
prototype JavaScript framework.

96
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,690
Now don't worry, if you're a
jQuery or a MooTools fan, you

97
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,910
can very easily replace these
defaults with your JavaScript

98
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,130
library of choice.

99
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,090
Next up is the cross site
request forgery meta tag.

100
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,140
This will prevent zombie hacker
sites from submitting

101
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,410
comments spam into
your website.

102
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,520
You'll notice that, if you look
at the source of your

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,560
Rails page, that it's putting
these csrf param and csrf

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
token meta tags right
in at the top.

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,270
And then it's going to
automatically include these in

106
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,300
every form in your application
to make sure that you don't

107
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,620
get hacked.

108
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,290
Next, we need to talk
a little bit about

109
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,150
root path and images.

110
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,820
So when somebody goes to your
Rails app and puts slash

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,500
something and types something
besides the root, the first

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,860
thing it's going to do is
check inside your public

113
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,880
directory to see if it exists.

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,810
If it doesn't, then it's going
to go and try to execute

115
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,870
inside Rails.

116
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,640
A good example of this
is your images.

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,180
If that file exists, it's
going to render it.

118
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,600
Now we're going to learn
how to create links

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,900
in our Rails views.

120
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,970
So here's part of our view where
we're printing out the

121
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,330
zombie name, but what if we
wanted to link to the Zombie

122
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,340
Show page to get more
information about that

123
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,120
particular zombie.

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,500
In that case, we have our Ruby
percent equals tag, and we're

125
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,670
going to say link_to
tweet.zombie.name.

126
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,560
And then the path is going to
be zombie_path(tweet.zombie)

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,060
So we have our link text and
then we have our link path.

128
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,360
This is going to render out
some pretty common HTML.

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,290
And there's another way we can
write this which is a little

130
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,260
bit simpler.

131
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,200
We can simply put the link text,
and then just put the

132
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,500
actual object to show,
which, in this

133
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,270
case, is just a zombie.

134
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,400
Rails can automatically look at
that model and figure out

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,550
what the right path is to view
that particular zombie.

136
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,360
This helper method link_to has
a lot of different options.

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,980
And you might be asking, how
do you figure out what all

138
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,160
those different options are?

139
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
Well. there's a couple
different ways you

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,740
can figure that out.

141
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,070
The first one is, you can
look in the source.

142
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,050
So you could type, get clone
and clone the Rails source.

143
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,000
And then go into your Rails
directory and open whatever

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,310
text editor you use, and then
search for def link_to to

145
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,210
figure out where that method
definition is and

146
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,480
read through it.

147
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,260
The second option you
have is to look at

148
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,730
api.rubyonrails.org.

149
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,230
These are the API
docs for Rails.

150
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,310
And, obviously, you could use
your browser to search through

151
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,680
all of those.

152
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,110
The third way is by going
to apidock.com/rails.

153
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,520
These are searchable,
online-only

154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,180
documentation with comments.

155
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,995
The fourth way is to look at the
Rails Searchable API Doc

156
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:08,590
at railsapi.com This you can
also download, or you can just

157
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,710
use it online.

158
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,360
It has a really nice Ajax
search feature.

159
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,580
And it's really easy to get
through and read the code.

160
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,010
So here you can see, we've
looked for link_to.

161
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,800
And one of the options under
link_to is to have a confirm

162
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,900
box when somebody
clicks the link.

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,030
So if we add confirm, are you
sure, to our link, when

164
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,810
somebody clicks on it, it's
going to pop up a JavaScript

165
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,950
alert that says, are you sure?

166
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,110
So we just got finished going
through the show action to

167
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,300
show a particular tweet, but
what might the index action

168
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,120
look like where we list
out all the tweets?

169
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,520
Well, it might look a little bit
like this in our browser,

170
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,000
where we're listing the
tweets just like that.

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,050
And here's what the code
might look like.

172
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,170
So, the header, we're
listing tweets.

173
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,120
We're starting a table.

174
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,800
We then say Tweet.all.each
to iterate

175
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,540
through each of the tweets.

176
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,920
And there's our basic
code block.

177
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,300
Inside there, we're going to
print out the tweet status,

178
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,025
and the tweet zombie name
for each of the tweets.

179
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Just to review what each piece
of this code returns, when we

180
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,610
call capital tweet, we get
returned a class, which we

181
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,450
then call all on.

182
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,920
.all returns an
array of tweets.

183
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,590
Now as we iterate through each
of them, we store each of

184
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,290
those tweets inside the
lowercase tweet.

185
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,520
What if we wanted to make
these both links?

186
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,090
We would link to the show tweet
and link to the show

187
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,730
zombie actions.

188
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,750
Well, we would add link_to, then
we'd specify the tweet.

189
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,270
And then we would add
a link_to, and

190
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,160
then specify the zombie.

191
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,780
Let's go and build out a little
bit of functionality.

192
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,970
Right now, if we don't have any
tweets, it has nothing.

193
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,860
What we want to do is print
out no tweets found.

194
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,020
So here's our code down here.

195
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,730
First thing we're going to do
is we're going to move out

196
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,240
tweet.all and store that
in a tweets variable.

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,250
We're going to move that tweets
to be what we iterate

198
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,370
through when we call dot each.

199
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,720
And then, at the bottom, we're
going to say, if tweets size

200
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,420
equals zero, then print
out no tweets found.

201
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,130
We can simplify this code a
little bit by calling

202
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,050
.empty?

203
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,080
And if that's true, then it'll
print out no tweets found.

204
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,680
As you can see, it does here.

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,980
Now what if we wanted to add
edit and delete links to the

206
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,850
list of tweets, so we could
very quickly edit them and

207
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,990
delete them?

208
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,310
What would the code
look like then?

209
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,880
Well, here we're going to
add a link_to "Edit"

210
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,950
And we're going to say,
edit_tweet_path(tweet)

211
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,230
And to add a delete link, we
say link_to delete, specify

212
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,950
the tweet, and then give
it a method of delete.

213
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,330
Now I'm going to give you a
quick summary of all the

214
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,790
different paths you might use in
your link_to in Rails, and

215
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,330
maybe also in the lab that
you're about to do.

216
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,110
So to list all the tweets,
you're going to

217
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,830
use the tweets_path.

218
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,870
That's going to generate
a tweets URL.

219
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,410
To link to a new tweet form,
you'd use the new_tweet_path

220
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,650
to generate this URL.

221
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,390
For the remainder of the paths,
you're going to need to

222
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,620
reference a specific tweet.

223
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,600
So here we're getting a
tweet with ID of 1.

224
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,610
To show it, we're simply going
to pass in the tweet object,

225
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,000
which will generate this URL.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,510
To edit it, we're going to put
in edit_tweet_path (tweet).

227
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,490
And we're going to
get this URL.

228
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,050
And to delete the tweet, we're
going to simply specify it,

229
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,670
specify the method as delete.

230
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,910
And that's going to generate
the path tweets/1.

231
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,180
That brings us to Zombie Lab
Three, where you can get your

232
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,960
hands dirty trying out
some of this code.
