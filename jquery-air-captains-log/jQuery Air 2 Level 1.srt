[SINGING]

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,690
While on jQuery Air, you'll
arrive super quick.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,080
With our in-flight
service, you'll

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,290
learn code with a click.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,260
Yes, now all this and more
taught by Greg Pollack.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,280
We hope you enjoy your flight.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,950
I'm Greg and I'll be
your Captain this

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,100
evening on jQuery Air.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,330
Welcome to jQuery Air 2.

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,600
I'm Greg Pollack, and in this
level, we're going to be first

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,130
doing a little bit of review
on selectors to make sure

12
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,410
we're on the same page.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,650
We're then going to talk about
name spacing using a dollar

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,350
sign, data tags, binding events,
unbinding events, and

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,220
then finally, we'll talk about
live and delegate.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,510
So we're going to start out
looking at some HTML, and then

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,450
we're going to run some
selectors against it.

18
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,730
You may notice that this HTML
has an HTML5 data tag.

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,670
We can use this data tag to
store variables and little

20
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,190
pieces of data that
we may want to use

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,490
later in our jQuery.

22
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,510
To get the first item in
this list, we would use

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,620
this jQuery code here.

24
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,730
It would return the link.

25
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,450
If you wanted to get the text
to that link, we could do

26
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,099
this, and it would return
September 27.

27
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,100
To get the href of a link, we
could call attribute href, and

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,410
we get back this.

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,560
And then finally, if we wanted
to get the value of the data

30
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,080
tag, we could call data
'flights,' and that

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,500
would return 6.

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,320
What we're going to be building
together in this

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,630
level is something that
looks like this.

34
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,240
It's a little flight
reservation page.

35
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,530
So here, you can hover over each
of the tabs, and it tells

36
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,280
you how many flights are
available on that day.

37
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,980
And if I want to see the flights
on that day, I can

38
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,820
click on that tab, and then it
will go and fetch the flights

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,180
and show me what's available
for that

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,780
day along with prices.

41
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,750
So let's start building.

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,160
So here's the HTML that we saw
a second ago with all the

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,090
dates that we have
flights for.

44
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,680
Let's write some jQuery.

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
We want this to run only
when the document

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,250
object model is ready.

47
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,130
We're going to say, for each
link, preventDefault, so we

48
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,990
don't want it to follow
that link.

49
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,750
Then let's remove the active
class from the tab that's

50
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,400
currently active, and let's add
it to the class that we

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,470
clicked on.

52
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,260
We can clean up this
code a little bit.

53
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,500
We're going to take some of
this code and wrap it in a

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,790
function called changeTab, then
our click event is simply

55
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,700
going to call that function.

56
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,430
Instead of using document ready,
we're going to use a

57
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,870
slightly different syntax,
syntax that looks like this.

58
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,010
What this does is it executes
the DOM when it's loaded just

59
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,670
like document ready, but it also
ensures that that dollar

60
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,570
sign is namespaced to the jQuery
object, so if we're

61
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,600
using other JavaScript
frameworks that also use that

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,870
dollar sign, here we're going
to make sure that the code

63
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,220
inside here, that dollar
sign, refers to jQuery.

64
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,270
So let's jump into the browser,
and you can see here,

65
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,890
we can click on each
of the tabs, and it

66
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,060
properly gets selected.

67
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,670
But we might also want a default
tab, maybe that middle

68
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,900
one, September 29.

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,470
Let's make that the default.

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,570
So when we call up the page
for the first time, that's

71
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,370
already selected.

72
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,630
The way we're going to do that
is simply by grabbing that

73
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,560
link and calling the
click event on it.

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,700
You'll notice here, I'm using a
different selector you might

75
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,320
not have seen before, eq(2).

76
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,490
That's going to select
a third element.

77
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,420
The first tab would be eq(0),
the second tab would be eq(1),

78
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,575
and the third tab, which
we want, is eq(2).

79
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,950
So here, you can see in the
browser, September 29 is

80
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,240
selected by default.

81
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,990
We can click off of that, and
whenever we refresh the page,

82
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,080
it's going to select
September 29 again.

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,530
Next up, we're going to use that
data flights attribute so

84
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,370
that we can create a tool tip,
so when we hover over each of

85
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,380
the tabs, it'll show us
how many flights are

86
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,690
available for that date.

87
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,800
We want the tool tip look a
little bit something like

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,540
that, so let's take a look
inside of our code.

89
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,660
You can see here we have
our normal click event.

90
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,030
We already went over that.

91
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,090
We're also going to add a mouse
enter event, which will

92
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,350
call the showNumberOfFlights
function, and a mouseleave

93
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,020
event, which calls the
hideNumberOfflights function.

94
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,840
So first of all, in the
snowNumberOfFlights function,

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,600
we're going to grab the number
of flights out of the data

96
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,350
attribute, and we're going to
append a span with the number

97
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,900
of flights in it.

98
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,920
For the hideNumberOfFlights
function, all we're going to

99
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,320
do is call remove
on the tool tip.

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,520
So just remove that element.

101
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,130
We can refactor this
code a little by

102
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,700
using the bind command.

103
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,100
Since all of these events are
happening on the same element,

104
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,920
we can write it like this.

105
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,980
So we just say bind,
and then we have a

106
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,890
list of all the events.

107
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,635
In the browser, here's
what our tool tip's

108
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:33,990
going to look like.

109
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,890
So you can see here, we hover
over each of the tabs, and it

110
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,140
tells us how many flights
are available.

111
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,460
So we have tabs, but we need to
add some divs where we put

112
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,670
the flight data.

113
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,040
So let's go ahead and write them
out, as you can see here.

114
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,240
Right now, we're just going
to put the loading

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,480
text in each of them.

116
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,830
You'll notice that the href
matches the ID of the divs

117
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,450
down below.

118
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,450
This is no coincidence.

119
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,510
We're going to be using
that in just a minute.

120
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,600
Let's shrink down our HTML and
make some room for our jQuery.

121
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,770
Here's our changeTab function.

122
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,720
We've already walked through
this code, but now we're going

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,330
to add a hide call to hide all
the divs, and then we're going

124
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,440
to find the active div by
looking up the attribute on

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,650
the link that was just clicked,
and we're going to

126
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,340
use that to find which div
we should be showing.

127
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,270
We're going to refactor this
code a little bit by creating

128
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,220
a showFlights function.

129
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,290
We'll just send in the active
div to the showFlights

130
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,900
function, and that'll hide all
the divs and show the one

131
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,310
that's active.

132
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,330
So if we jump into our browser
at this point, we can see that

133
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,220
as we click the tabs, it
properly shows the div that

134
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,090
we're looking at.

135
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,445
Pretty cool.

136
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:45,480
So we're selecting the proper
divs, but we don't have the

137
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,240
flight data in there yet.

138
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,310
We want to be able to load that
in, and we want to load

139
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,570
it using AJAX, but we're not
going to cover AJAX until the

140
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,320
next level.

141
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,800
So for now, we're just going
to call the showFlights

142
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,230
method, and that's going to load
in the proper flights.

143
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,600
So let's jump back
into the browser.

144
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,630
So now, we have flights, and
we can click on each of the

145
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,360
tabs to select the flights.

146
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,700
Pretty cool.

147
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,460
You'll notice, though, that if
I click a tab, every time I

148
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,720
click the tab, even if it's the
active tab, it's going to

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,640
do another call back to the
server, another AJAX call,

150
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,710
which isn't so good.

151
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,880
To stop the event from
happening, we're going to

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,640
learn how to use the
unbind function.

153
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,870
So here, you can see I'm getting
the active link, and

154
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,020
I'm unbinding the click
event on it.

155
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,520
Since I'm unbinding the event,
when I click off of that tab,

156
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm going to want
to rebind it.

157
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,250
So I'm simply going to
add click(changeTab).

158
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,740
It should be said that this
the same thing as saying

159
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,210
bind(click", changeTab).

160
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,290
It does the same thing,
just different syntax.

161
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,020
So if we go back into our
browser now, we can see that

162
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,580
when we click a tab and keep
on clicking on that tab, it

163
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,090
doesn't cause an AJAX request
to happen every time.

164
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,020
Pretty cool.

165
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,100
When you're binding events, you
should know that you can

166
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,640
namespace each of
these events.

167
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,130
Here you can see I'm
namespacing click.

168
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,280
So I'm just giving it an extra
.flightSchedule name.

169
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,670
Then when I want to unbind
it, I have to

170
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,120
reference that same name.

171
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,600
Alternatively, I could add that
namespace to all of the

172
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
different events.

173
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,510
If I did this and I wanted to
unbind all those events all at

174
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,920
once, I could simply call
unbind(".flightSchedule").

175
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,010
The next piece of functionality
we want to add

176
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,020
is the ability to select an
individual price, to basically

177
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,620
pick out the flight and pick
out if we want to do first

178
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,090
class or coach.

179
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,690
And as we click on a
different one, that

180
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,960
one should get selected.

181
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
Here's what the HTML looks like
on our flights table.

182
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,460
You can notice that one of these
has class selected, and

183
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,320
that's what's going
to highlight

184
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,450
that particular flight.

185
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,780
Let's jump into the jQuery
to make this work.

186
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,100
So here we're going to bind
on the click action.

187
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,190
It's going to call the
selectFlight function.

188
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,240
Inside of the selectFlight
function, we're going to

189
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,360
preventDefault.

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,670
We're then going to remove the
selected class from the one

191
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,920
that's currently selected, then
we're going to add the

192
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,910
selected class to the one
that we just clicked on.

193
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,090
If we jump into our browser and
try this out, notice that

194
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,010
it doesn't seem to work.

195
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,560
We're clicking on stuff and
nothing's getting highlighted.

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,660
That's because we shouldn't be
using the bind function.

197
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,700
What we should be using
is the live function.

198
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,320
Because we're loading in that
flight data dynamically using

199
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,710
AJAX, we need to have it look
for that event no matter

200
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,870
what's on the page.

201
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,660
What bind does is it goes
through, it only hooks onto

202
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,220
that event one time.

203
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,590
What live does is it looks for
that selector, and whenever it

204
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,700
finds that, whether it's now or
in the future, it's going

205
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,930
to properly catch that event and
call the right function.

206
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,000
So if we jump back in our
browser, we can now click on

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
the different prices and
select our flights.

208
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,950
Using live, like we showed you
there, turns out to be not

209
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,360
such a good practice.

210
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,410
There's a better way
to bind events.

211
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,295
Live, this line up here,
is the same as saying

212
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:22,670
(document).delegate.

213
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,440
So what that (document).delegate
thing is

214
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,710
saying is on the document, the
highest level document, look

215
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,630
for the click event that matches
this selector, and so

216
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,130
every time the click happens,
it's going to be trying to

217
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,120
match at the top event level.

218
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,690
Which isn't so good.

219
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,700
We can fine tune this command by
giving it the selector that

220
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,450
we want to be checking inside
for the click event on the

221
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,040
flight link.

222
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,070
There are two benefits
to using delegate.

223
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,900
First of all, it can
be method chained,

224
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,110
so you can have a bunch
of methods all up

225
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,160
against each other.

226
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,990
And secondly, as I mentioned
before, it also performs

227
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,310
faster because it only has to
be checking for that event,

228
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,330
for that element, in this part
of the code instead of the

229
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,710
entire document, as
using live does.

230
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,930
That about does it for Level
1 of jQuery Air 2.

231
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,170
I hope you're ready to get your
hands dirty with some of

232
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,295
the code challenges.

233
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:19,545
Good luck.
