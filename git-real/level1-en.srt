00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,255


2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:06,970
Git, a distributed source
control repository.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,400
I tried to picture clusters of
information as they move

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,210
through the file system.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,820
Were the commit messages
like history books?

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,172
I kept dreaming of
a repository I

7
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,210
thought I'd never see.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,205
And then, one day: Git Real.

9
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:27,750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,940
You're watching Level
One of Git Real.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,550
I'm Gregg Pollack, and in this
level, we're going to go over

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,200
some of the real basics
of using Git.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,500
So if you're already familiar
with these basics, maybe you

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,350
did tryGit, feel free to skip
over the video and go straight

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,690
to the challenges.

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,340
The first time I got a gig
working with the web it was

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,400
pretty typical.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,030
So there I was, first
day on the job and I

19
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,880
needed to edit a website.

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,830
I was told to FTP the file down,
make changes locally,

21
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,860
and FTP them back up which works
fine until you find out

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,670
there is somebody else who is
also working on a project.

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,060
And at times they may pull
down the same file, make

24
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,290
changes, and you both may try
to upload and override each

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,510
other's changes.

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,540
And it's a big mess.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,620
This is where you might need
a version control system.

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,530
So what is a source control
repository and what

29
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,450
does it do for you?

30
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,670
Well the first thing it does is
it deals with these sort of

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,170
situations where you have two
different people working on

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,650
the same file, and you both
check in that same file, it

33
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,080
will try to merge that
file for you.

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,350
The second and more important
thing is that it works as a

35
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,480
time capsule.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,010
So over time as you make changes
to files and you check

37
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:35,330
them into your source control,
it keeps a time log so that

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,450
you've got a complete history
of all the files that have

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,970
changed and even why
they changed.

40
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,270
You can see these are
all the different

41
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,610
versions in version control.

42
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,040
Up until recently, most version
control systems used a

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,700
centralized repository.

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,320
What this means is that you have
multiple people and when

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,230
they make changes and they make
commits and store that

46
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,660
history, it's all
going to central

47
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,790
repository, one server.

48
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,230
Some version control systems
like Git are distributed.

49
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,020
This means that everybody has
a complete copy of the repo.

50
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,430
The nice thing about this is
that you can make commits

51
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,900
really quickly.

52
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,000
You can work on it offline,
and everybody

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,190
has a complete copy.

54
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,630
That way if one gets destroyed,
everybody has a

55
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,810
copy of the repo.

56
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,300
Unlike working with a
centralized repository, if you

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,590
lose all your backups and
your server goes down,

58
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,610
you are out of luck.

59
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,560
So now what it means when we
called Git a distributed

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,650
version control system,
or DVCS.

61
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,950


62
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,780
Git was created by Linus
Torvalds, when he was working

63
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,130
on the Linux operating system
and he lost access to the

64
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,770
proprietary version control
system he was using.

65
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,710
He wanted to create something
new, something that was fast,

66
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,230
that's distributed, and was good
with working with large

67
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,480
code bases, like Linux.

68
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,020
Most people work with Git
on the command line.

69
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,140
So in this course we're going
to be teaching all of the

70
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,540
command line tools.

71
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,770
That being said, there's still
a lot of graphical user

72
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,520
interfaces that you
can check out.

73
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,360
And if you want to install Git
or download some of those

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,150
GUIs, you can go over
to git-scm.com.

75
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,030


76
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,630
Like most command line tools,
Git comes with a help system.

77
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,120
So if you ever get stuck,
you can run git help.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,390
It'll give you a list
of the commands.

79
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,010
And then if you want to get more
specific, you can type

80
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,270
git help and then the command
you need more information

81
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,360
about and it'll have pretty
good documentation.

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,230
Your first step when you install
Git is to set some

83
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,640
basic configuration.

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,760
You're going to want to set your
username, your user email

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,130
because what good is filling a
commit with awesome code if

86
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,520
you can't take some credit
for it, right?

87
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,380
And we're going to run one
last command to get some

88
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,730
pretty colors on the output
of our command line.

89
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,530
So you've installed Git and
you're ready to work on your

90
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,500
first repository.

91
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,090
We're going to need a directory,
so let's create a

92
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,080
directory if we haven't.

93
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,820
We're going to go into
that directory.

94
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,000
We can work on some files at
this point, and we're ready to

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,980
start the repository, we
simply type git init.

96
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,490
This is going to create a
local Git repo for us.

97
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,990
It's not up on any server,
it's local.

98
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,800
It's actually stored in that
.git hidden directory.

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,140
You're never going to need to go
in to that directory, just

100
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,770
know that's where
it's all stored.

101
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,050
Let's start working with Git.

102
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,149
And we're going to talk about
our workflow before we get

103
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,180
into commands.

104
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,820
So Jane, our user here, is going
to create a readme file.

105
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,300
That readme starts
out as untracked.

106
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,630
When we're ready to start
tracking that file we're first

107
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,600
going to add it to
a staging area.

108
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,450
We're getting ready to
take a snapshot.

109
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,360
Then, we're going to create
our first commit.

110
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,000
And a commit is like taking a
snapshot of those files that

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,260
we put on the stage.

112
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,510
We then might work in our
project more, maybe we modify

113
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,500
the readme and add a license.

114
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,670
We're going to add those files
to the staging area and make

115
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,810
another commit.

116
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,610
So this is the workflow
for Git.

117
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,540
You do a little bit
of work, you stage

118
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,960
it, you make a commit.

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,920
Let's jump into the commands.

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,220
One of the most important
commands with Git is the git

121
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,680
status command.

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,690
This is going to tell
you what has changed

123
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,340
since your last commit.

124
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,020
So we've run git status, we
don't have any commits yet.

125
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,300
It's going to tell us that we
have one newly created file

126
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
that's not being tracked.

127
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,240
To start tracking it we
first need to add it

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,340
to the staging area.

129
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,520
We do that using the git add
command doing git add README.

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,730
And if we do another git status
at this point, we're

131
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,850
going to see that this file is
now ready to be committed,

132
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,430
it's currently staged.

133
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,300
Now we're ready to make
our first commit.

134
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,580
We do this by running git
commit -m, and then we

135
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,210
describe what these
changes do.

136
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,580
So in this case, create
a readme.

137
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,980
When we run that command this
creates our first commit which

138
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,280
takes a snapshot of the stage.

139
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,490
And that gets added
to our timeline.

140
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,970
If we run git status at this
point we can see that there's

141
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,170
nothing else to commit, there's
no other changes or

142
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,420
files that we've modified that
we haven't committed yet.

143
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,060
Git status also tells us that
we are on branch master.

144
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,530
All you have to understand here
is that we've got one

145
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,410
main timeline at this
point and we're

146
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,610
going to call it master.

147
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,490
We'll get more into branches
on Level Three.

148
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,550
Now we're going to do some
work on some files.

149
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,370
We're going to modify the readme
and add a license.

150
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,230
Now if we run git status, we're
going to see that our

151
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,340
tracked file, readme,
has been modified.

152
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,070
It's keeping an eye
on that file so it

153
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,570
knows it has been modified.

154
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,860
And we have a new file we need
to add that's not tracked

155
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,800
called license.

156
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,060
We want to commit both these
file so we need to add them

157
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,600
both to the staging area.

158
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,930
We can do this by simply
doing git add, and

159
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,370
listing both of the files.

160
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,150
Or we can do git add --all,
which will add up all new,

161
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,190
modified, or deleted
files to our stage.

162
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,150
Now if we run git status again,
we're going to see we

163
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,780
have two files that are
ready to be committed.

164
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,280
So from here, we need to go back
and do another commit.

165
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,230
So here you can see we
do git commit -m.

166
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,810
Now we can commit our changes
off of the stage and specify

167
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,640
what the commit does,
in this case, add

168
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,570
license and finish readme.

169
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,450
This is going to create a
snapshot and add a commit to

170
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,600
the top of our timeline.

171
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,540
Now we have two commits, but
how do we list from the

172
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,340
command line what those are?

173
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,960
How do we look at the history?

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,970
That's where the git log
command comes in.

175
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,400
So if we run it here we can see
we have our two commits

176
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,840
listing the author, the date,
and our commit message.

177
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,090
As you can imagine when you're
working on a larger project,

178
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,480
commit messages are very,
very important.

179
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,240
And so you want to try to be as
descriptive as possible as

180
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,790
to what they do.

181
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,080
Plus it's good to keep
in the present tense,

182
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,090
not the past tense.

183
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,950
I could've said created
a readme file.

184
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,820
It might be tempting to do that,
but what you want to do

185
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,280
is think about what
the commit does.

186
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,460
In this case, create a readme.

187
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,540
Now we're going to go over some
different ways to use the

188
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,710
add command.

189
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,390
As you saw you can simply
list out files.

190
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,270
You can use git add --all.

191
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,890
git add *.txt will add
all the text files

192
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,160
in the current directory.

193
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,550
If we want, we can specify
a directory

194
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,990
like docs/*.txt.

195
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,840
We can also add all the files
in a specific directory and

196
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,410
all of its sub-directories
by doing git add docs.

197
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,940
And lastly, if you put quotes
around *.txt, it's going to

198
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,270
go add all the txt files
in the entire project.

199
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,180
You've reached the
end of Level One.

200
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,330
It's time to start
running your own

201
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,580
commands and Git Real.

202
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,308
