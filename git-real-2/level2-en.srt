1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,120
You're watching Get Real 2.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,840
And this is level 2, where
we're going to be talking

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,890
about stashing.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,890
So there you are working on a
feature branch, and you're

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,100
about part way through a commit,
when your boss calls

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,149
and says, hey, there's
something

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:16,860
wrong with the server.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,850
I need you to make a
commit right now

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,450
to the master branch.

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,760
And you go, well, huh.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,700
I need to go back over to the
master branch, but I'm right

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,700
in the middle of this HTML file,
about halfway done with

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,360
this gerbil right here.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,119
And you can't go ahead and
commit it halfway through.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,330
That would be kind of bad.

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,360
So what do you do?

17
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,960
Well this is where stashing
comes in.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,030
Stashing allows you to take some
files that may not make

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,510
up a full commit and store them
away in a temporary area.

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,080
So you can restore them
at a later time.

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,760
So in our case, if we run git
stash save, it's going to take

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,460
those files haven't been
completed yet, and it's going

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,770
to save them away in
a temporary area.

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,950
It's also going to restore the
state from the last commit.

25
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,340
So in this case, if I git diff,
there's no changes.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,350
And if I run git status, I can
see that there's nothing to

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,620
commit on our gerbil branch.

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,370
So now we can safely go back
over to our master branch from

29
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,490
here, and make all the
changes that we need.

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,620
We can pull down updates.

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,630
We can make commits.

32
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,050
And we can push up
the changes.

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,990
Now when we're ready to resume
working on our feature branch,

34
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,260
we can go ahead and check out
that particular branch, and

35
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,000
then run the command
git stash apply.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,120
This will re-run the changes
that we stashed away before so

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,370
that we continue working
on that code, and

38
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,620
eventually make a commit.

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,890
Every time you run git stash
save, it pushes that stash

40
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,060
onto the stash stack.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,910
It's a stack of stashes.

42
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,160
So if you run git stash list,
you'll see a list of all of

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,900
the stashes that you've
used there.

44
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,350
You'll see it says WIP, as in
work in progress, on master.

45
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,919
That's the branch where
we stashed.

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,780
And it gives you the last commit
before we stashed.

47
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,410
Because a stash is
not a commit.

48
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,560
It's giving you the commit that
was right before the time

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,540
that we stashed.

50
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,080
The stashes are each given a
name that you can reference if

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,460
you want to apply
a certain stash.

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,390
So we wanted to apply just the
middle stash, stash number 1,

53
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,300
we could call git stash apply
stash 1 like you see here.

54
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,080
And it would be applied
to our code.

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,170
Stash 0--

56
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,130
obviously that's the one at
the top of the stack--

57
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,330
is going to be applied by
default if we don't specify a

58
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,130
stash by name.

59
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,520
When we run the stash apply
command, it's going

60
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,030
to apply our stash.

61
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,350
But it's not going to pop our
stash from the stash stack.

62
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,990
In order to drop that stash off
the stack, we can run git

63
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,250
stash drop, like so.

64
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,920
And that's going to remove
it from the list.

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,110
And we can see if we run
git stash list again.

66
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,360
We can see that it's gone.

67
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,800
There's some intelligent
defaults for

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,890
running stash commands.

69
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,110
For example, we can just run git
stash, and it's the same

70
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,270
thing as running
git stash save.

71
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,030
If we run git stash apply, it's
going to run the stash at

72
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,070
the top of the stack, which
is going to be stash 0.

73
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,160
Git stash drop is going to
automatically drop the stash

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,230
at the top of the stash stack.

75
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,780
And lastly there's the git stash
pop command, which runs

76
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,610
git stash apply and
git stash drop.

77
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,370
So it actually applies a stash,
and then pops it off of

78
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,110
the top of the stack.

79
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,470
Just like when you merge
branches, there is the

80
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,710
possibility of running into
conflicts or other problems

81
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,070
when you try to take two files
and put them together, and

82
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,790
merge them together.

83
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,520
So when you run git stash apply,
well sometimes you

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,720
might get an error message
that looks like this.

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,850
In this case, it wasn't able
to modify the local file.

86
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,590
So what it says here is commit
your changes or stash them

87
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,010
before you go ahead and try to
run your stash apply command.

88
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,860
So it actually didn't
run the stash apply.

89
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,620
It's saying, this isn't going to
work until you either roll

90
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,700
back your changes or commit
your changes.

91
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,320
Then do the apply again.

92
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,620
Sometimes when you run git
stash apply, it will just

93
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,070
merge and it won't abort, in
which case you're either going

94
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,420
to want to merge the changes and
make a commit, or maybe

95
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,830
even roll back.

96
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,630
If you're using the stash pop
command and you find some

97
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,230
merge conflicts, you'll want
to resolve them as usual.

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,220
However, you should note that
it doesn't automatically pop

99
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,660
the stash off of the stack.

100
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,380
That's because you might want
to just do a hard reset and

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,470
then do the pop command again.

102
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,380
So it doesn't assume that you
want to delete that stash.

103
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,200
So in this case, if it does run
into conflicts when you're

104
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,970
using pop, you're going to want
to go back into the stash

105
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,430
list and manually
drop that stash.

106
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,790
So Jane is currently working on
some code, and she has some

107
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,470
changes she wants to commit
and some that she wants to

108
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,300
stash for a later commit.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,060
Well she might try running
git stash save

110
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,670
on her working directory.

111
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,690
But, if she runs git status,
she'll find that it stashed

112
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,930
everything, including
the staging area.

113
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,780
So that wasn't right.

114
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,710
Let's get our changes
back into our

115
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,930
current working directory.

116
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,850
So if Jane runs git stash
pop, it's going

117
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,990
to restore the state.

118
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,290
And you'll notice there that git
stash will save both the

119
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:51,550
changes in the staging
and unstaged area.

120
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,650
So let's try this again and this
time we'll use the

121
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,300
--keep-index option.

122
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,570
What that's going to do is keep
around the files that we

123
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,620
already have staged and
ready to commit.

124
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,210
So now if we run git status,
we'll see that only our

125
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,660
unstaged files have
been stashed.

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,580
Now Jane can go ahead and
make that commit.

127
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,220
And then to restore the files,
she can run git stash pop.

128
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,470
And then she can get
back to work.

129
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,400
But what if some of the files
that Jane needed to stash

130
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,700
weren't tracked files?

131
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,840
So they were brand new files
that were just created.

132
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,970
Well, when she ran git stash
save, and then run git status,

133
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,960
she would see that those
untracked files aren't getting

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,270
saved into the stash.

135
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,890
It's only going to stash files
that git knows about.

136
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,750
To fix this, we can run git
stash save with the

137
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,820
--include-untracked option.

138
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,680
This is going to include all
of the untracked files.

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,050
So after we run that, and we
run git status, we can see

140
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,680
that it has properly
stashed it.

141
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,880
And then to unstash it, we can
run git stash pop, and it will

142
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,880
properly pop, tracked
and untracked

143
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,970
files off of the stack.

144
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,790
When you have a bunch of stashes
is in your stash list,

145
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,610
sometimes it may be hard to tell
them apart and figure out

146
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,120
which one you want.

147
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,950
Well luckily, we can run this
with several options.

148
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,100
We could run this with the
--stack command, as

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,780
you see here.

150
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,230
And it would list out all the
different stats for all the

151
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,360
different stashes.

152
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,270
But really we can use any option
that we would typically

153
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,650
use with the git log command.

154
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,370
We can use the options here to
get more details about each of

155
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,250
the stashes.

156
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,230
If we want more information
about one particular stash, we

157
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,770
can run git stash show, and then
specify the name of that

158
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,920
stash, like you see here.

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,160
If we run git stash show, and
don't specify any stash, well

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,320
it's going to show us details
about the most recent stash.

161
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,730
Just like git stash list, git
stash show can take any option

162
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,210
that the git log
command takes.

163
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,370
So in this case, we
could do git stash

164
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,120
show dash dash patch.

165
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
It shows the file changes
within the stash.

166
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,140
When you run git stash save, you
can optionally provide a

167
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,680
stash message, just like
a commit message.

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
And then when you run git stash
list, you're going to

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,845
see that message on the list.

170
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,380
So Gregg is back working on the
gerbils again, and well he

171
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,280
started working on the
gerbil toy section.

172
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,120
But then again management called
and said, hey, you need

173
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,260
to go ahead and deploy those
gerbil things that you're

174
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,169
working on.

175
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,090
So let's go ahead and stash
save the toy section that

176
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,550
we've been working on.

177
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,610
And then we will maybe merge
our existing code over into

178
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,000
master, to deploy to master.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,810
But what if hypothetically,
Gregg destroyed that gerbil's

180
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,910
branch, the one where we stashed
the current work we

181
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,270
did on toys.

182
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,450
Well now we need a new branch
to restore that

183
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,430
stashed toys page.

184
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,280
Well we can use this command,
git stash branch gerbil toys

185
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,430
stash zero.

186
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,080
What this is going to do is
it's going to create a new

187
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,520
branch name, called gerbil toys,
and it's automatically

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,180
going to pop off of the stash
the work that we did on gerbil

189
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,100
toys onto that branch.

190
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,840
Then, we can go ahead and
make our first commit

191
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,090
onto this new branch.

192
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,320
One last thing before you
get to the challenges.

193
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,250
What if you have a bunch of
stashes in your stash list,

194
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,930
and you no longer need them?

195
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,270
Well, that's where they git
stash clear command comes in.

196
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,390
If you run that command, that
blows away all your stashes,

197
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,640
as you can see here.

198
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,110
Now it's time for you to start
stashing things away in the

199
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,200
challenges.

200
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,450
See you in the next level.
